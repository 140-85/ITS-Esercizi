# EXERCISE 1 - Write a program that creates two variables, r and pi. Assign pi the value of the mathematical constant (or a suitable approximation of it) and give r any value you want.

r = 42
pi = 3,14

# EXERCISE 2 - Use the variables from the previous question to create a third variable called area that holds the area of a circle with radius r.
